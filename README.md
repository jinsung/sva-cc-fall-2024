## DESCRIPTION
- This course explores computer programming as a tool for visual communication and interactivity between a computer and people. It is a project-based course in which students learn computer programming through hands-on experiences. The p5.js library will be used to illustrate the fundamentals of computation throughout the semester.

## Students with Disabilities

In order to receive academic accommodations due to a disability, a student must first register with the Office of Disability Services (ODS). Students approved for accommodations will be given an ODS Accommodation Letter to submit to their instructors. If a student does not provide an ODS Accommodation Letter to their instructor, they will not be eligible to receive accommodations in that course. All instructors are required to adhere to SVA’s policies regarding accommodations for students with disabilities. Students who have a need for academic accommodations, or suspect they may have a disability, should contact the ODS via telephone: 212-592-2396, or visit the office: 340 East 24th Street, 1st Floor, New York, NY 10010, or email: disabilityresources@sva.edu.

## SVA BFA Design & Advertising Department AI Statement
August 2024
+++
The Department recognizes that like all technological advancements, the presence, evolution,
and rapid integration of AI is not something that can be ignored, dismissed, or discounted.
The Department believes that AI can be an effective, useful, and powerful tool in the classroom
but is not a substitute for critical and strategic thinking, creativity, spontaneous insights, and
interpersonal collaboration.
The Department encourages students to always be curious, experimental, innovative, and
hard-working. As part of these efforts students may make use of and work with AI but never as a
replacement for the qualities listed above.
The Department cautions that the ease and polish of AI should not result in an altered dynamic
whereby students passively cede control of and visions for their work to AI.
The Department requires that students who make deliberate use of AI ensure that proper credit
is given in the classroom, portfolio, and any award/competitions. At minimum, credit should
include the AI tool (ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc) and preferably a brief explanation of specific
elements in the work that were created using AI.
The Department requires students to be able and willing to present the full creative process of any
project in order to defend against accusations of improper and/or dishonest AI usage.
The Department reminds students that while each instructor’s AI policy varies, in general, work
made using AI risks relinquishing any copyright, ownership, and other IP concerns that a
student might otherwise retain over their work.
It remains at the discretion of each individual faculty member to determine how, if at all, AI is
utilized by students in each course they teach. Individualized policies ought to be clearly
included in each syllabus and discussed, as necessary, at the start of the course.
